## Rolemodels Platform

This project is an online platform for organizing school visits by role models and professionals or for students visiting companies. The platform connects schools and more specifically specific classes with companies and individual professionals (a parent or volunteer can enroll).
Our message may be that education is a function of society as a whole.
